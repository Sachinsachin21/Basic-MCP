# Leave Management Assistant (MCP-based)

This project is a simple **Leave Management System** built using [FastMCP](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) — a framework for building agentic tools via the MCP (Modular Command Protocol). It allows employees to check their leave balance, apply for leave, and view their leave history.

## Features

- ✅ **Check Leave Balance**  
- 🗓️ **Apply for Leave with Specific Dates**  
- 📜 **View Leave History**  
- 🙋 **Personalized Greeting Tool**

All operations are handled via an in-memory mock database (for demonstration purposes).
